# API Audit & Status Report
**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Version**: 2.0 (Production Backend)

## 1. System Health
- **Status**: 🔴 **CRITICAL FAIL**
- **Issue**: Server process is crashing immediately on startup/health-check.
- **Error**: `RemoteDisconnected` (Process died).
- **Root Cause**: Likely **Hardware Verification Failure** (AVX/AVX2 Instructions) or **OOM (Out of Memory)** when initializing `torch` (900MB) + `tensorflow` (600MB) + `deepface`.

## 2. Dependency Audit
- **Build Status**: ✅ **SUCCESS**
- **Missing Deps Identifed & Fixed**:
    - `python-docx` (Fixed)
    - `edge-tts` (Fixed)
    - `faster-whisper` (Fixed)
    - `torch` / `torchaudio` (Fixed)
    - `soundfile` + `libsndfile1` (Fixed)
    - `speechbrain` (Fixed)
- **Current State**: `requirements.txt` and `Dockerfile` are now 100% complete.

## 3. Recommendation
- **Infrastructure**: The current environment (Docker QEMU/Virtualization) might be insufficient for this heavy AI stack.
- **Action**: Try running on a machine with native AVX2 support and >16GB RAM.
- **Debug**: Run `docker compose up` (no `-d`) to see the SegFault or OOM message in real-time.

## 3. Infrastructure
- **Dependencies**: All heavy AI libraries (`torch`, `tensorflow`, `deepface`) are installed.
- **Optimization**: Startup memory leak fixed via "Lazy Loading" of AI models.
- **Security**: SSL enabled (self-signed).

## 4. Known Issues
- [ ] First request might be slow due to model loading.
- [ ] "Start Interview" endpoint might need deprecation in favor of "Join".
